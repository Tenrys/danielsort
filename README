DanielSort - A really stupid script for sorting files in your folder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Danielsort is your usual run-off-the-mill sorting script for categorizing files inside a messy folder, 
because it's always a pain trying to sort folders sometimes.

The script takes an argument on argv[0] or your current working directory, and sorts it based on five categories

* Documents
* Audio
* Videos
* Applications
* Miscellanous

Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need Deno: https://deno.land/

You may also use the precompiled version but I cannot assure if it works, YMMV as always.


Why is it called DanielSort?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was made for one person I specifically wanted to "help" on a Discord community, so I decided
to make this script on a weekend in one sitting.
